# Football Administrator Project

## Description
This Python script simulates a simple football match administrator. It allows the user to input the status of a match and, if the match has been played, determines the result based on the number of goals scored by the home and away teams.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the match status.
- Handles two scenarios:
  - If the match is suspended, it prints a message.
  - If the match is played, it takes the number of goals scored by both teams and determines the result (home win, away win, or draw).
- Provides an error message for invalid inputs.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rumsha703/Python-Mastery.git
